# Approach

I will start by choosing six popular movie and asking 5 people to rate the movies on a 1-5 scales. I will store the data in a postgresql database. I plan to use a normalized relational schema with three tables:
* users(user_id, name)
* Movies(movie_id, title)
* ratings(user_id, movie_id, rating)

I will then use R to load the data into a dataframe which will allow me to handle missing values.
